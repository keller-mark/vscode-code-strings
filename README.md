# vscode-code-strings

A VSCode extension which enables syntax highlighting for language A (child language) within strings written in language B (parent language).

When this extension is enabled, comments in language B immediately before the string definition can enable this behavior.
For example, to enable highlighting of a string containing JS code within a Python script, the developer would write:

```python
# lang: js
my_js_str = """
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
"""
```

The extension will highlight the contents of the string using the specified language's syntax.
